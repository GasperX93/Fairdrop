# Fairdrop

Fairdrop is a file transfer dapp. It’s the first blockchain product by Fair Data Society and one whose design is based entirely on the Fair Data Society (FDS) principles. It doesn’t collect any data, runs on the Ethereum network and uses Swarm’s decentralised storage system as its functional backbone
